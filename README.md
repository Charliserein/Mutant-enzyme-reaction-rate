# Mutant-enzyme-reaction-rate

our experimental group utilized engineered bacteria expressing heterologous superoxide dismutase (SOD) to eliminate excess ROS in the IBD intestinal environment, thereby aiming to alleviate IBD symptoms. For this therapeutic approach, we sought to visualize the therapeutic effects and predict treatment outcomes. To this end, our computational group developed a ROS clearance model using the Michaelis-Menten equation. This enzymatic kinetics model illustrates the relationship between the enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate (v), substrate concentration ([S]), and enzyme concentration ([E]). The model effectively represents the ROS-clearing activity of SOD and helps validate the accuracy of the experimental results obtained in the wet lab.
